fuzzyplates
===

This is a boilerplate for all your derpy app ideas. Quickly create a typical Silicon Valley one-pager explaining your app at a high-level and collect e-mail sign-ups from those interested. The e-mails will be collected and stored on your Evernote. With this, you can create as many of these fuzzyplates as you want and keep track of how good an idea is in one place (your FuzzyPlates Subscribers notebook!)

Instructions
==

Documentation is lacking right now, but basically you'll need to:

1. get an Evernote API key
2. get your OAuth access token (run locally, hit endpoint /oauth)
3. Configure config.json and config.yml accordingly (see .template for notes!)
4. Tweak the template to your liking
5. When you're satisfied, you need to request Evernote to activate your API key for production
4. Deploy!
